## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
#### -Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
Vehicle Length and Ground Clearance
#### -Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
The slope of the linear model is not considered to be zero. The p-value is smaller than the significance level which means the null hypothesis is not true.
#### -Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
The r-squared value of the linear regression model is 0.7149. This is 71.49% which means the linear model does predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively.
